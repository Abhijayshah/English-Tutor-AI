- Self-learners who prefer flexible, self-paced learning

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Questions

### Q4: What is the overall architecture of your application?
**Answer:**
The application follows a client-server architecture:
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with HTML5 and CSS3, utilizing Web Speech API
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO for bidirectional communication
- **AI Integration**: OpenRouter API for multiple AI model access
- **Data Storage**: Local storage for user preferences and session data
- **Security**: Helmet.js for security headers, rate limiting, CORS protection

### Q5: Why did you choose Node.js for the backend?
**Answer:**
I chose Node.js because:
- **Real-time capabilities**: Excellent support for WebSocket connections via Socket.IO
- **JavaScript ecosystem**: Unified language across frontend and backend
- **NPM packages**: Rich ecosystem for AI integration, security, and utilities
- **Asynchronous nature**: Perfect for handling multiple concurrent voice sessions
- **Rapid development**: Fast prototyping and deployment capabilities
- **Scalability**: Event-driven architecture suitable for real-time applications

### Q6: Explain the real-time communication implementation.
**Answer:**
I implemented real-time communication using Socket.IO:
```javascript
// Server-side connection handling
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  // Track active connections
  connections.set(socket.id, {
    connectedAt: new Date(),
    lastActivity: new Date()
  });
  
  // Handle voice messages
  socket.on('voice-message', async (data) => {
    // Process speech and generate AI response
  });
});
```
This enables:
- Instant message delivery
- Real-time voice processing feedback
- Connection status monitoring
- Session management

## 🎤 Speech Technology Questions

### Q7: How did you implement speech recognition?
**Answer:**
I used the Web Speech API with fallback handling:
```javascript
const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
let recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
recognition.continuous = true;
recognition.interimResults = true;
recognition.lang = AppState.settings.language;
```

Key features:
- **Cross-browser compatibility** with webkit fallback
- **Continuous recognition** for natural conversation flow
- **Interim results** for real-time feedback
- **Language selection** supporting multiple English variants
- **Error handling** with detailed diagnostics

### Q8: How do you handle speech synthesis?
**Answer:**
I implemented speech synthesis using the Web Speech API:
```javascript
function speakText(text) {
  const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
  utterance.voice = selectedVoice;
  utterance.rate = 0.9;
  utterance.pitch = 1.0;
  speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
}
```

Features include:
- **Voice selection** from 100+ available voices
- **Rate and pitch control** for optimal learning
- **Queue management** to prevent overlapping speech
- **Interrupt capability** for natural conversation flow

### Q9: What challenges did you face with browser speech APIs?
**Answer:**
Several challenges and solutions:

## 🤖 AI Integration Questions

### Q10: How did you integrate AI models into your application?
**Answer:**
I integrated multiple AI models through OpenRouter API:
```javascript
const response = await axios.post(CONFIG.apiUrl, {
  model: selectedModel,
  messages: conversationHistory,
  temperature: 0.7,
  max_tokens: 500
}, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

This provides:
- **Multiple model access** (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- **Cost optimization** through model selection
- **Fallback mechanisms** for reliability
- **Rate limiting** for API protection

### Q11: Explain the different AI tutor personalities you implemented.

3. **Conversation Partner**: Engages in natural dialogue while subtly correcting errors
4. **Vocabulary Builder**: Introduces new words and teaches contextual usage
5. **Fluency Coach**: Helps improve speaking rhythm and confidence

Each personality has custom prompts that guide the AI's responses and teaching style.

### Q12: How do you ensure consistent AI responses?
**Answer:**
Consistency is maintained through:
- **Structured prompts** with specific formatting requirements
- **Context preservation** through conversation history
- **Response parsing** to extract learning feedback
- **Fallback responses** for API failures
- **Temperature control** (0.7) for balanced creativity and consistency
